Dead-Stock-Register
===================

A web application intending to provide an easy access to the managers in managing the dead stock register that every institute maintains. It eases in adding, updating and deleting a stock without any difficulty as compared to the conventional register. 

It gives a user interface to the managers and at the same time keeps an easy back-up of the entire database. The website offers a multi-user interface which can be used on the roam anywhere.
